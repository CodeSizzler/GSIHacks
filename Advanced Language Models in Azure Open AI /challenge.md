<h1>Challenge</h1>

In this hack, you need to develop an Azure Open AI app on how different prompts for similar content help shape the AI modelâ€™s response to better satisfy your requirements.

Imagine you are trying to send out information for a new wildlife rescue, and you need to get assistance from a generative AI model.

<b>You have been given a sandbox environment for this demo and you can use the same to execute the solution for the hack scenario.</b>
